## About Me

I'm **Michael Redenti**, an HPC Scientific Application Engineer at [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/) in Bologna, Italy. My work focuses on performance portability of scientific codes on GPU-accelerated supercomputers and building monitoring infrastructure for HPC systems.

I hold a Masters by Research from the [MAC-MIGS Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.mac-migs.ac.uk/) at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked on mathematically-driven algorithms for quantum molecular dynamics.

## Experience

### HPC Scientific Application Engineer — CINECA
**Bologna** | Apr 2023 – Present

- Improved performance portability of flagship codes within the Centre of Excellence for Exascale in Solid Earth across AMD and NVIDIA GPU-accelerated HPC systems through systematic performance analysis and optimisation.
- Architected a cloud-hosted performance monitoring infrastructure combining ReFrame and Grafana on OpenStack to centralise benchmarking data, accelerate root-cause analysis, and proactively identify HPC system and application performance degradation after maintenance cycles.

### Application Developer — Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre
**Edinburgh** | Jul 2022 – Mar 2023

- Involved with the development of SiMLInt, an ExCALIBUR programme led by the MET Office, creating an interface that seamlessly integrates deep learning into large-scale physical simulations.
- Acted as a mediator between the data engineering team and the domain experts of the School of Maths at the University of Edinburgh.

### Application Developer (Intern) — HomePointr CIC
**Edinburgh** | May 2019 – Aug 2019

- Collaborated with the Software Development team to design, develop and deploy a social-housing allocation engine to reduce the rates of public housing offer rejection.
